- way for community to collaborate on creating, grading, and ascenting routes
- climbing stats such as first ascent (FA), buffless (Bl.), redpoint, etc.

# Creating a Route
A route is just a path through the features of a mountain face. However, to be approachable and informative, we must add more information.

- Route Name
- Location
- Type
- Description
- Image / Video Media
- Grade

### BEFORE ADDING A ROUTE, PLEASE PLEASE _PLEASE_ CHECK THE EXISTING MAP. IT ONLY TAKES A FEW CLICKS. YOU MUST HAVE AT LEAST 20 HOURS IN THE GAME (connect Steam/PlayStation account) TO ADD A ROUTE.

backend notes:
- only one route creation per day (except for known routesetters (10 accepted routes) / experienced Cairners)
- description using MarkDown
- steam/psn connection support
- ui for route page should be simple and easy to read at a glance
- discussions section for each route
- how to handle route variations / cross-routes?
- voting and favoriting system for each route
- accepting a route????????????????

# Ascenting a Route
An ascent is a climb from the bottom of a route to the very top. Ascents are counted with falls, pitons, and buffs. For an ascent to be a __redpoint__, there can be pitons but _NO falls / going off belay_. For an ascent to be __buffless__, one _cannot use any food or drink obtained buffs and no chalk_.

- Select Route
- Proof of Ascent
- Date/Time of Ascent
- Description of buffs, pitons, falls etc.
- Climber's Grade (has no effect on setter's grade)

backend notes:
- at most 5 ascents per day
- crystallize what counts as proof of ascent
- provide standardization for description to make it easy
- allow climber's grade to be changed later
